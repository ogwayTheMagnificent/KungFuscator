# KungFuscator

KungFuscator is a Lua obfuscator with the following features:

- Bytecode manipulation to make it harder to reverse engineer Lua code.
- Constant array obfuscation to hide the values of constants in the code.
- Proxified locals to make it harder to read and understand variable names.
- Lua virtualization to obfuscate the control flow of the code.
- So much more!

These features can be used together or individually to obfuscate Lua code and make it more difficult for attackers to understand and modify.

KungFuscator is designed for Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and LuaJIT, and can be used with any Lua codebase that is compatible with these versions.
